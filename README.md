# rpi_cnc
Code and configurations developed for running LinuxCNC on a Raspberry Pi for 3D printer use.

I intend to run my to-be-built-from-scratch 3D printer on LinuxCNC using a Raspberry Pi 3 as the computing platform.
This platform has no built-in provisions for interfacing with the necessary hardware such as stepper motors, temperature sensors, etcetera. Therefore, some custom code has to be developed.
